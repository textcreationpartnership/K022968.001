by the ſame publiſher, and aſſerted in the title to be written by the
ſame author. This circumſtance was never contradicted by Mr. Pope. The hint
for the performance was probably taken from Dr. Swift's letter, July 23, 1737,
where he obſerves—From theſe volumes of letters might be
collected the beſt ſyſtem that ever was wrote for the conduct of Human
Life.As to the other poems, they ſpeak for themſelves; and as they
were univerſally acknowledged to be Mr. Pope's at their firſt appearance,
they will not, we preſume, be diſputed now.

degree of ſucceſs, after he had retired to Hampſtead; but three other
phyſicians being ſoon ſettled in the place, his profits at laſt became
very inconſiderable. He kept no houſe, but was a boarder. He was much
eſteemed, and ſo frequently invited to the tables of gentlemen in the
neighbourhood, that he had ſeldom occaſion to dine at home. An ancient
inhabitant of Hampſtead, now living, was preſent at his funeral. He was
ſuppoſed to be very indigent at the time of his death, as he was interred
on the 12th of February 1726 in the meaneſt manner, his coffin being little
better than thoſe allotted by the pariſh to their poor who are buried from
the workhouſe; neither did a ſingle friend, or relation, attend him to the
